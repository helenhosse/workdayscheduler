# Work Day Scheduler
##  USER STORY

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
## Description

In this challenge, I made a site that you can store your daily schedule. It will update the time and date at the top of the page each day as well as color code each section depending on the date. It will grey out if the hour has past, show red if there is a conflict during the time and green if there is any free parts of the day.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
## Installation
I have provided 2 links at the end of this page that should be able to work on any device.
